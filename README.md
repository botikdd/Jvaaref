# Jvaaref

This project is about to write a mini robot pilot for an Audi RS4 which is 10 times smaller than the original one. This model will have:
*  a camera
*  6 distance sensors
*  a Raspberry PI

Using these tools, we have to write a program to the car to be able to:
*  move in the traffic
*  find parking place and to park (parallel or perpendicular to the edge of the road)
*  recognize traffic and road signs

Our scope is to make a precise software, which avoid accidents and can navigate easily in the traffic.
